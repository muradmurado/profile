          Education is the process<br>
           of acquiring knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. <br>
           It is a lifelong journey of learning and gaining <br>
          <br>experiences that shape an individual's understanding of the world around them, <br>
          their place in it, and their ability to contribute to society. Education takes various forms,<br>
           including formal schooling, informal learning, and practical experiences.
